Preventing deadlock in a multi-threaded application requires careful design and implementation of the application's concurrency control mechanisms. Here are some strategies to help prevent deadlock:

1. **Use locks wisely**: Use locks sparingly and only when necessary. Avoid using locks unnecessarily, as they can lead to deadlocks.
2. **Use lock-free data structures**: Use lock-free data structures, such as concurrent queues or stacks, to avoid the need for locks.
3. **Use atomic operations**: Use atomic operations, such as compare-and-swap (CAS) or load-linked/store-conditional, to update shared data without the need for locks.
4. **Use thread-safe collections**: Use thread-safe collections, such as `CopyOnWriteArrayList` or `ConcurrentHashMap`, to avoid the need for locks.
5. **Avoid nested locks**: Avoid using nested locks, as they can lead to deadlocks.
6. **Use lock timeouts**: Use lock timeouts to prevent deadlocks by setting a timeout for lock acquisition.
7. **Monitor and debug**: Monitor and debug your application to detect and prevent deadlocks.
8. **Use deadlock detection**: Use deadlock detection algorithms, such as the Floyd's cycle detection algorithm, to detect and prevent deadlocks.
9. **Use lock-free algorithms**: Use lock-free algorithms, such as the Michael-Scott algorithm, to avoid the need for locks.
10. **Test and validate**: Test and validate your application thoroughly to ensure that it is deadlock-free.

**Best practices**

1. **Use a consistent locking strategy**: Use a consistent locking strategy throughout the application to avoid confusion and errors.
2. **Use locks only when necessary**: Use locks only when necessary, and avoid using them unnecessarily.
3. **Use lock-free data structures**: Use lock-free data structures to avoid the need for locks.
4. **Use atomic operations**: Use atomic operations to update shared data without the need for locks.
5. **Avoid nested locks**: Avoid using nested locks to prevent deadlocks.
6. **Use lock timeouts**: Use lock timeouts to prevent deadlocks by setting a timeout for lock acquisition.
7. **Monitor and debug**: Monitor and debug your application to detect and prevent deadlocks.
8. **Use deadlock detection**: Use deadlock detection algorithms to detect and prevent deadlocks.
9. **Use lock-free algorithms**: Use lock-free algorithms to avoid the need for locks.
10. **Test and validate**: Test and validate your application thoroughly to ensure that it is deadlock-free.

By following these strategies and best practices, you can help prevent deadlocks in your multi-threaded application.
