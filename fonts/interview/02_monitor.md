As a Java developer, I use a variety of tools to profile and monitor Java applications. Here are some of the tools I commonly use:

**Profiling Tools**

1. **YourKit**: YourKit is a popular profiling tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.
2. **Java Mission Control**: Java Mission Control is a profiling tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.
3. **VisualVM**: VisualVM is a profiling tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.
4. **Eclipse Memory Analyzer**: Eclipse Memory Analyzer is a profiling tool that provides detailed information about memory usage and garbage collection.

**Monitoring Tools**

1. **New Relic**: New Relic is a monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into application performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.
2. **AppDynamics**: AppDynamics is a monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into application performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.
3. **Datadog**: Datadog is a monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into application performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.
4. **Grafana**: Grafana is a monitoring tool that provides real-time insights into application performance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.

**Other Tools**

1. **Java Flight Recorder**: Java Flight Recorder is a tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.
2. **Java Mission Control**: Java Mission Control is a tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.
3. **Eclipse Debugging**: Eclipse Debugging is a tool that provides detailed information about CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection.

**Why I use these tools**

I use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize application performance, and troubleshoot issues. These tools provide valuable insights into application performance, allowing me to:

1. Identify performance bottlenecks
2. Optimize application performance
3. Troubleshoot issues
4. Monitor application performance in real-time

By using these tools, I can ensure that my Java applications are performant, scalable, and reliable.
