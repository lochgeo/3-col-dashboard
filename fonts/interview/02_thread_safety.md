In Java, `synchronized` and `Lock` are two different mechanisms for achieving thread safety and concurrency control. While both can be used to protect shared resources from concurrent access, they have distinct differences in terms of their implementation, usage, and performance.

**Synchronized**

1. **Keyword**: `synchronized` is a keyword in Java that can be used to synchronize a block of code or a method.
2. **Implementation**: When a thread enters a `synchronized` block or method, it acquires a lock on the object's monitor, which is a built-in lock mechanism in Java.
3. **Usage**: `synchronized` is typically used to protect shared resources from concurrent access, ensuring that only one thread can access the resource at a time.
4. **Performance**: `synchronized` can be expensive in terms of performance, as it involves acquiring and releasing locks, which can lead to contention and performance degradation.

**Lock**

1. **Class**: `Lock` is a class in Java that provides a more fine-grained control over concurrency, allowing developers to create custom locks and synchronization mechanisms.
2. **Implementation**: `Lock` is implemented using a `ReentrantLock` or a `ReentrantReadWriteLock`, which provides a more flexible and efficient way to manage concurrency.
3. **Usage**: `Lock` is typically used to create custom locks and synchronization mechanisms, allowing developers to fine-tune concurrency control and optimize performance.
4. **Performance**: `Lock` can be more efficient than `synchronized` in terms of performance, as it provides more control over concurrency and can be optimized for specific use cases.

**Key differences**

1. **Implementation**: `synchronized` is implemented using a built-in lock mechanism, while `Lock` is implemented using a custom lock implementation.
2. **Usage**: `synchronized` is typically used to protect shared resources from concurrent access, while `Lock` is used to create custom locks and synchronization mechanisms.
3. **Performance**: `synchronized` can be expensive in terms of performance, while `Lock` can be more efficient and optimized for specific use cases.
4. **Customizability**: `Lock` provides more customizability and flexibility in terms of concurrency control, allowing developers to fine-tune synchronization mechanisms.

In summary, `synchronized` is a built-in mechanism for achieving thread safety and concurrency control, while `Lock` is a more flexible and efficient mechanism that provides more control over concurrency and synchronization.
