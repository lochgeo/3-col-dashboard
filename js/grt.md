## Prompt : Liquidity components includes (Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, short term investments, revolving credit facilities, revolver, revolving line of credit, credit facility, ABL Facility/Facilities). Deduct any commercial paper outstanding/letter of credit. Please output the total liquidity, previous year liquidity and reasons for change in liquidity

Answer: To calculate the total liquidity, we need to consider the components mentioned in the context and deduct any commercial paper outstanding/letter of credit.

Components of Liquidity at Dec. 31, 2022:
- Cash: $1,655 million
- Short-term investments: $1,239 million
- Committed credit facility agreements: $5.75 billion

Total Liquidity at Dec. 31, 2022:
$1,655 million (Cash) + $1,239 million (Short-term investments) + $5.75 billion (Credit facility agreements) = $8.644 billion

Previous Year Liquidity at Dec. 31, 2021:
- Cash: $1,757 million
- Short-term investments: $1,382 million

Total Liquidity at Dec. 31, 2021:
$1,757 million (Cash) + $1,382 million (Short-term investments) = $3.139 billion

Reasons for Change in Liquidity:
The increase in liquidity from $3.139 billion in 2021 to $8.644 billion in 2022 can be attributed to the higher amount of credit facility agreements available and unused at Dec. 31, 2022. The committed credit facility agreements increased from an unspecified amount in 2021 to $5.75 billion in 2022, providing a significant boost to liquidity. Additionally, changes in cash and short-term investments may have also contributed to the increase in liquidity.

## Prompt : Please provide a trend analysis of the last 2 years of CFFO (Cash flow from operations)

Answer : In 2021, the Cash flow from operations (CFFO) was $4.651 billion, while in 2022 it decreased to $3.720 billion. This represents a decrease of approximately $0.931 billion from 2021 to 2022. The decrease in CFFO can be primarily attributed to the significant increase in working capital in 2022, consuming $1.709 billion of liquidity compared to $45 million in 2021. This increase in working capital was mainly driven by a $1.7 billion increase in receivables (32%) and a $0.7 billion increase in inventories (22%) from 2021 to 2022. Additionally, the increase in working capital was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities that provided cash of $0.7 billion in 2022.

Overall, the trend analysis of the last 2 years shows a decrease in CFFO from 2021 to 2022 due to the significant increase in working capital in 2022 compared to 2021.
