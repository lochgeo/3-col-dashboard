## Real-time Collaboration Platform" challenge

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implement a secure user authentication system using industry-standard practices like OAuth 2.0 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

2. **Document/Project Management**: Users should be able to create new documents or projects, view a list of existing ones, and access them for collaboration.

3. **Real-time Text Editing**: Multiple users should be able to edit the same document simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time for all collaborators. Implement features like cursor tracking, user presence indicators, and synchronized scroll positions.

4. **Version Control and Conflict Resolution**: Maintain a versioned history of document changes, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed. Implement conflict resolution mechanisms to handle concurrent edits on the same section of the document.

5. **Collaborative Annotations and Comments**: Users should be able to add annotations, comments, or markers to specific sections of the document, facilitating discussion and collaboration.

6. **Notifications and Activity Feeds**: Implement a notification system to inform users about changes made by other collaborators, new comments, or important events. Additionally, provide an activity feed to track the progress and changes made to a document or project.

7. **Access Control and Permissions**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or similar mechanisms to manage permissions for different user roles (e.g., owner, editor, viewer) within a document or project.

8. **Search and Filtering**: Allow users to search and filter documents or projects based on various criteria, such as title, content, tags, or collaborators.

9. **Chat or Messaging**: Integrate a real-time chat or messaging system to enable communication among collaborators within the platform.

**Non-functional Requirements:**

1. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and real-time updates without performance degradation.

2. **Responsiveness and Low Latency**: Ensure a responsive user experience with minimal latency for real-time updates and smooth text editing.

3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: The platform should be accessible and usable across different devices and operating systems (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones).

4. **Security and Data Protection**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data, such as encryption at rest and in transit, secure communication protocols, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

5. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance**: Design the system to be fault-tolerant, with mechanisms for handling network disruptions, server failures, and data consistency issues.

6. **Audit Logging and Analytics**: Implement logging and analytics features to track user activities, system performance, and potential security threats.

7. **Extensibility and Integration**: Design the platform to be extensible and integrate with third-party tools or services, such as storage providers, authentication services, or collaboration tools.

8. **User Experience and Accessibility**: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface, adhering to best practices for usability and accessibility standards.

These requirements cover the core features and non-functional aspects of a real-time collaboration platform. During the hackathon, participants can focus on implementing a subset of these requirements or explore additional features based on their interests and the available time.

## Gamification Platform challenge

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Management**: Implement a user authentication and authorization system to manage users and their profiles within the gamification platform.

2. **Application Integration**: Develop a flexible and extensible architecture that allows existing applications to integrate with the gamification platform seamlessly. This could involve providing APIs, SDKs, or plugins for different programming languages and frameworks.

3. **Leaderboards**: Implement leaderboards that display user rankings based on various criteria, such as points earned, achievements unlocked, or specific in-app actions. Support different leaderboard types (e.g., global, team-based, time-based) and filtering options.

4. **Badges and Achievements**: Allow applications to define and award badges or achievements to users based on specific criteria or milestones reached. Provide a mechanism for users to view and track their earned badges or achievements.

5. **Points and Rewards System**: Implement a points-based reward system that allows applications to assign points to users for completing specific tasks or actions. Provide a mechanism for users to redeem their earned points for rewards or incentives.

6. **Challenges and Quests**: Enable applications to create and manage challenges or quests for users, with defined objectives, rules, and rewards. Support different challenge types, such as time-based, team-based, or individual challenges.

7. **Social Features**: Integrate social features like activity feeds, leaderboard sharing, and user-to-user interactions (e.g., challenges, gifting) to foster engagement and competition within the gamification platform.

8. **Analytics and Reporting**: Provide comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities to track user engagement, progress, and performance within the gamification platform. This should include customizable dashboards, metrics, and data visualization tools.

9. **Notifications and Alerts**: Implement a notification system to inform users about new achievements, challenges, leaderboard updates, or other relevant events within the gamification platform.

10. **Admin Console**: Develop an admin console or dashboard for managing and configuring the gamification platform, including user management, application integration, leaderboard settings, badge definitions, and reward configurations.

**Non-functional Requirements:**

1. **Scalability**: Design the platform to handle a large number of concurrent users, applications, and gamification events without performance degradation.

2. **High Availability and Reliability**: Ensure the platform is highly available and fault-tolerant, with mechanisms for handling failures, load balancing, and data consistency.

3. **Security and Data Protection**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data, such as encryption, secure authentication, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

4. **Performance and Low Latency**: Optimize the platform for low latency and high throughput, ensuring real-time updates and responsive user interactions.

5. **Extensibility and Customization**: Design the platform to be extensible and customizable, allowing applications to tailor the gamification experience to their specific needs and branding.

6. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensure the platform is compatible with various operating systems, devices, and web browsers, providing a consistent user experience across platforms.

7. **Integration and Interoperability**: Facilitate integration with third-party services and platforms, such as authentication providers, payment gateways, or social media platforms.

8. **Localization and Internationalization**: Support multiple languages and locales, enabling the gamification platform to cater to a global user base.

These requirements cover the core features and non-functional aspects of a gamification platform. During the hackathon, participants can focus on implementing a subset of these requirements or explore additional features based on their interests and the available time. The platform should be designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind to accommodate diverse gamification scenarios across various application domains.
