## Background
In the technology department of a large bank, the complexity of interdependent applications and the deployment of micro frontends present significant challenges. Observability, the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs, is crucial in addressing these challenges. It offers a comprehensive view into system performance, revealing the intricate web of dependencies between applications. This visibility is essential for diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring seamless operations.

In the context of micro frontends, where multiple teams develop and deploy discrete parts of a larger application independently, observability provides critical insights. It helps track and manage the lifecycle of each component, facilitating smoother integrations and faster resolutions of deployment issues. Observability tools enable teams to monitor the health, performance, and interactions of these micro frontends, ensuring they function cohesively.

For a bankâ€™s technology department, effective observability means reduced downtime, enhanced reliability, and improved customer experience. It supports proactive identification of potential issues, thereby minimizing the risk of disruptions in banking services. Moreover, it empowers teams with data-driven insights, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation. By prioritizing observability, the bank can enhance its operational resilience and agility, crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

## Challenge
In our upcoming hackathon, we are excited to present two pivotal challenges aimed at enhancing observability within our technology ecosystem. The first challenge involves creating a Micro Frontend (MFE) Health Dashboard. This dashboard will serve as a comprehensive tool to monitor the status and performance of individual micro frontends, providing real-time insights into their health and operational metrics. The goal is to enable teams to swiftly identify and address issues, ensuring robust and reliable user experiences.

The second challenge focuses on developing a Centralized API & Service Dependency Map. This initiative seeks to map out and visualize the intricate dependencies between various APIs and services within our banking applications. By centralizing this information, we aim to provide a clear and detailed overview of how different components interact, facilitating better troubleshooting, impact analysis, and system optimization. Both challenges are designed to push the boundaries of observability, driving innovation and operational excellence in our technology landscape.
